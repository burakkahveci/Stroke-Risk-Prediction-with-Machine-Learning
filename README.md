# Stroke Risk Prediction with Machine Learning Models

## Introduction 
* A stroke is a serious life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.
#### Signs and symptoms of stroke include:

* Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying. You may experience confusion, slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech.
* Problems seeing in one or both eyes. You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.
* Trouble walking. You may stumble or lose your balance. You may also have sudden dizziness or a loss of coordination.
